# Nemesis

Nemesis is a image flagging system used to flag NSFW content. It acts like a bridge between the frontend and api. Whiling posting if a image is added it checks for any potential NSFW content that could be in the Post. If it is there it will flage and not allow the post to go through.

## Requirements
Make sure your Go ver is above 18.4

Setup the .env right to get the best results
