Nemesis is an image flagging system used to detect NSFW content. It acts as a bridge between the frontend and API. During posting, if an image is added, Nemesis checks for potential NSFW content. If detected, it flags the image and prevents the post from going through.

## Requirements
Ensure your Go version is 1.18 or above.

Set up the `.env` file correctly for optimal performance.
